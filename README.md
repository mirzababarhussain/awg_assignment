Task: Full-stack API-based Development Exercise (Laravel + Vue/React)
The goal of this task is to create a full-stack application using Laravel for the backend API and
either Vue or React for the frontend. This exercise focuses on your coding skills, integration with
external services, and clean, original code. Understanding and correctly implementing the
requirements is also a critical part of this task. Please complete the following requirements
and submit the work as instructed.
Requirements
1. Backend (Laravel API)
o Google-based Login: Implement a login functionality using Google authentication,
specifically using Gmail IDs. The login should be API-based and secure.
o Google Lighthouse API Integration: Create an endpoint to test website performance
using the latest version of the Google Lighthouse API. Your API should:
 Accept a URL.
 Accept a platform selection (either "Mobile" or "Desktop") to specify the device
type for the Lighthouse test.
 Return only the "Performance" score for the given URL and platform. Use the
following endpoint for this:
https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed.
2. Frontend (Vue or React)
o Build a simple frontend that allows users to:
 Log in via Google.
 Enter a website URL in a single text box.
 Select either "Mobile" or "Desktop" to specify the device type for the
performance test.
 Retrieve and display the performance score from the backend API in a clean,
responsive UI.
